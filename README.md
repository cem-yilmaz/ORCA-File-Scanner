# ORCA-File-Scanner

## Description

This is a python script to filter out required information from ORCA output files. The file to be read from can be chosen by changing the path within main(). Currently the script is able to find: final single point energies, geometry optimization energies (and plot), final molecular orbiral energies, Loewdin atomic charges, vibrational frequencies (and plot) and 1H NMR values (and plot). In future more ORCA capabilities will be added as well as potentially expanding to other ab initio software packages.
